This is a command to generate a new {console formatting pattern}.

In addition to the {name} of the new {{Pattern}}, a {delimiter}
is also required. The {delimiter} is a pattern of characters
that are used to target a string that should have
some formatting applied to it.

The {delimiter} can either be a single string or it can be a pair
of {opening} and {closing} {delimiters}.

The styling that gets applied to matches can be specified
in the {{Pattern}} class which gets generated in
`console/Utilities/Formatting/Patterns/`

The {regex} that is used to detect matches can also be tweaked
if necessary. The pattern that gets generated by this command
will work already in most cases.
But with certain characters, some additional escaping may required.
And in more complex cases, the pattern may need changing completely.

_Example_
If the {delimiter} is set as {^}
Then in the string {{Hello ^world^}}
The word {"world"} will have formatting applied to it.

The {delimiter} may also be a pair of strings.
Eg {<} and {>}
Which would match {<Hello>}
